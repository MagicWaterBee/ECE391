bug #1
Window doesn't scroll when player goes right. The player will stuck into the right boarder.
sol #1
Fixed draw_vert_line. The address for drawing is not simply switch x and y in draw_horiz_line.

bug #2
The characters in status bar scatter around and are not recognizable.
sol #2
The problem is that I didn't understand the VGA's 4 planes well. Adjacent pixels seperate a lot in video memory.

bug #3
The player will stuck into status bar.
sol #3
Modified IMAGE_Y_DIM in modex.h, limiting the image to not exceed the boarder of status bar.

bug #4
Implementation of masking wasn't working. The trace of player becomes mix-colored. Only black part ahead of player is eliminated.
sol #4
Instead of using one function, modified drawing function to let the previous image stored and draw again after show_screen().

bug #5
The color of wall and status bar didn't change.
sol #5
I wrote a function to change the array of palette, but didn't write it to corresponding register. Added two lines to load the palette.

bug #6
The text above fruits was messy.
sol #6
The printing method of fruit_text_buffer is different from text_to_buffer. One needs calculation and another uses absolute address in buffer.

bug #7
The text above fruits was black background and white text, no transparent color.
sol #7
When modifying the palette, should use original data instead of replacing it totally.
